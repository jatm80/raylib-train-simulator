# Go Translation of Raylib Rain Train

This repository contains a Go translation of the Raylib Rain Train project originally developed in Zig. The source code for the Zig implementation can be found in the [raylib_rain_train repository](https://github.com/RohanVashisht1234/raylib_rain_train).

## Overview

The Raylib Rain Train project demonstrates how to create a visual effect of rain and a moving train using the Raylib library. This translation aims to replicate the functionality and visuals of the original Zig code in Go, leveraging Raylib-go to maintain the same visual and interactive experience.

## Original Zig Code

The original Zig implementation is available at:
[raylib_rain_train](https://github.com/RohanVashisht1234/raylib_rain_train)

## Go Translation

The code in this repository translates the functionality of the original Zig project into Go. It uses the [Raylib-go](https://github.com/gen2brain/raylib-go) bindings for Go to achieve similar graphics and interactions.

### Features
